engine
======

A game engine, which will hopefully soon have a more creative repo name

It shall be written primarily in C++, because why not? It shall be snazzy.

What shall it do, you may ask? WELL, it's a game engine for 2D platform/adventure games. Hopefully an external library will be tied in to do the more intensive physics work.
