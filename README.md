engine
======

A game engine, which will hopefully soon have a more creative repo name.

It uses SFML for multimedia, and it'll probably deal with its own physics (though, if we use this for a game that has particularly difficult physics, we may use an external library for that until I can write my own).

The intension is to write a snazzy little game engine that we can easily build games off of. Though intended particularly for 2D platform/adventure/top-down games, it will be helpful for other game types as well. Note that SFML makes it really easy to use OpenGL, so 3D games may be a possibility! :D
