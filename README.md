engine
======

A game engine, which will hopefully soon have a more creative repo name.

The intension is to write a snazzy little game engine that we can easily build games off of. Though intended particularly for 2D platform/adventure games, it will be helpful for other game types as well.

It uses SFML for multimedia, and will use another library for harder physics work.
