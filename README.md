engine
======

A game engine, which will hopefully soon have a more creative repo name. It should also be moved to Postcursor Laboratories.
The intension is to write a snazzy little game engine that we can easily build more games off of, particularly 2D platform/adventure games.
It uses SFML for multimedia, and will hopefully use another library for harder physics work.
